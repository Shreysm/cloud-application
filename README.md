# cloud-application
Implemented a web page to three cloud services(IBM Bluemix, Microsoft Azure and AWS) and allow user to load dataset and query it. 
Also, perform various data visualizations, clustering and metrics on the dataset.

There are 6 parts in this project. Each part is deployed to one of the cloud services. Each task folder contains its code files and readme.

### Task 1 and 2

Provide a local interface using a web page, displayed in a browser to IBM Bluemix cloud that you will implement that will allow a user to upload
earthquake data and investigate it.

### Task 3 and 4

Deployed to Microsoft Azure cloud. Implements memcache.Visualize and display the results from the previous task within a browser, allow a user to select intervals or attributes in a data set, show
results as a pie chart, a histogram, or a scatter or point chart (possibly connected:a line). Google Charts  anf K-means clustering are used to implement.

### Task 5 and 6

Deployed to AWS. Using Jmeter, to drive the cloud application. Try several parameters, such as amount of requests per unit time, intervals between requests, and similar varia-tions
on request traffic. Using AWS facilities configure scaling to handle scaling up and down, by creating additional instances or removing instances, up to 4 instances in total.
